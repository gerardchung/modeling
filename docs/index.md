# Foreword

Quarantine 2020. 

I have decided to put my notes for the courses EPsy 8251 and 8252 into book form and make them available. As I revise the content, I will post things here. Feel free to offer criticism, suggestion, and feedback. You can either [open an issue](https://github.com/zief0002/modeling/issues) on the book's github page or [send me an email](mailto: zief0002@umn.edu) directly.
