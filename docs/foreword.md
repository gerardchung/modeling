# Foreword (First Edition) {-}


This book is truly different.

It is rare that a textbook with so few technical prerequisites offers so much of value, not just to its intended student audience, but also to all practicing statisticians. The book in your hands is one of those rare ones. It is the product---over years---of careful study and deep thought by its authors, who are practicing statisticians, education researchers, and root-deep innovators.

Statistics, its teaching and its learning, have seen a number of exciting developments over the last quarter century.  Among these:

1. Near-universal acceptance of the assertion that applied statistics textbooks should emphasize the priority of real data over mathematically driven abstract exposition.
2. A coming-of-age for computer-intensive methods of data analysis.
3. A parallel recognition by teachers of statistics that, along with an emphasis on real data and reliance on applied context, computer simulation offers an alternative to abstract derivations as an approach to exposition and understanding.
4. A cooperative development and broad embrace of R, the public domain, and open-source software, whose growing community of contributors has made cutting edge, computationally intensive methods freely available around the world.
5. A coming-of-age of statistics education as a research area in its own right, and, as a result, a growing clarity about  what is hardest for students to learn, and a sharpened focus on what is most important for students to learn.
6. A change at the foundations of our subject: What we can compute shapes what we can do; what we can do shapes what we actually do in practice; what we do in practice shapes how we think about what we do.  (As just one example, when I first was learning statistics in the 1960s, Bayesian analyses were typically dismissed as mere idealism; today, the combination of hierarchical models and Markov chain Monte Carlo has turned Bayes resistors into old fogeys.)

By integrating these developments in a novel way, *Comparing Groups* deserves to be regarded as one of this quarter-century's pioneering textbooks aimed at introducing nonstatisticians to contemporary thought and practice.

Many features are distinctive:

- The exposition is visual/intuitive/computational rather than haunted by the old headless horseman of abstract derivations.
- The writing is strikingly good---the exposition reflects the authors' careful attention to word choice. (In my experience, it is rare in statistical exposition to read with a sense that the writers made thoughtful, deliberate choices about wording after considering a variety of options.)
- The references are a gold mine.
- The use of modern graphics is unusual for a book at this level. I refer, in particular, to panel plots and kernel density estimates.
- Prerequisites are minimal. No calculus is needed.  Although it helps to know about vectors and matrices, one does not need a linear algebra course.
- The emphasis is practical throughout.  For example, the exposition refers systematically to APA guidelines and offers sample write-ups.
- Content reflects the current research  literature. For example, the exposition recognizes the importance of effect sizes, and the treatment of multiple testing addresses the recent research on false discovery rates.  
- Overall, the emphasis is on statistics with a purpose, statistics for deep interpretive understanding.

In short, this is a book that reduces prerequisites, avoids technical baggage, focuses on essentials, and teaches via authentic applications. It offers readers our profession's current best sense of how to understand data for comparing groups, taking full advantage of computationally intensive methods such as randomization and the bootstrap.
